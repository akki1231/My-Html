<title>My Favorite Subjects</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><i>I like school, but some subjects I like better than other. But dont get me wrong I love every subject (with the exception of CMA like bruh its so boring in 6,7, and 8th grade. 5th grade CMA was ok). Each subject was very close no large marginal eins only very small ones (except CMA its in the Negatives). I like school, tests and homework so this ranking does not mean any hate to any of them.</i></p>
